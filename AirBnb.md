Technical Phone Screen (Your Next Step)
This will be a 45-minute phone interview where you will be asked to code a working solution to a challenge. This stage will involve questions that can cover both platform-specific Android knowledge and CS fundamentals (would be good to brush up on algorithms, data structures, etc…). The platform-specific checks will test your familiarity with Android APIs and best practices. Your interview will be conducted in Coderpad (http://coderpad.io).
Here are some Coderpad resources if it's been a while since you've coded in that environment:

Onsite Interview
As I mentioned over the phone, this will be the point where I introduce you to your recruiter who will provide more information on this stage if/when we get closer to it. At a high level, this stage will include two Android-specific coding interviews, a general coding interview, an "experience" interview (where you talk about a project that showcases your skills), and two non-technical interviews. You will have access to Android Studio and your IDE of choice for the algorithm portion (choice of Sublime, IntelliJ, Android Studio). You can download any if you’d like.
How to succeed in your interviews
At Airbnb, we believe in collaboration and sharing ideas. Most importantly, you'll need more information from the interviewer to analyze and answer the question to its full extent.

When they ask you about the projects you’ve worked on, make sure that you show them a good understanding of why you chose the implementations that you did, and you weren’t just following a pattern without understanding it. It’s important to go into depth about the projects you’ve worked on to show what you’re passionate about.

It is OK to question your interviewer! If you don't understand something, ask for help or clarification.

When asked to provide a solution, first define and frame the problem as you see it and list out any assumptions you’re making.

Always talk through the problem! Always let your interviewer know what you are thinking as she/he will be as interested in your thought process as your solution.


CS Fundamentals Prep
Algorithms:

It’s critical that you understand big-O complexity analysis. Be able to identify the big-O complexity of a given piece of code, and know the complexity of common algorithms.

Sorting: Know the details of at least one n*log(n) sorting algorithm, preferably two, such as Quicksort and Mergesort.

Hash tables: Arguably the single most important data structure. You absolutely should know how they work. Be able to implement one using only arrays in your favorite language.

Trees and graphs: Know about basic tree construction, traversal and manipulation algorithms. Familiarize yourself with binary trees, n-ary trees, and tries. Be familiar with at least one type of balanced binary tree (red/black tree, splay tree, or AVL tree), and know how it's implemented. Understand tree traversal algorithms: BFS and DFS, and know the difference between inorder, postorder and preorder.

Know about the most famous classes of NP-complete problems, such as traveling salesman and the knapsack problem, and be able to recognize them when an interviewer asks them in disguise.

UI and System Design:

Brush up on your ability to build simple UI elements, best practices for doing so, and be prepared to discuss ways of improving user experiences if asked.

Be sure to review platform-specific design patterns, principles for caching, performance best practices, and scalability of systems.

Review core platform APIs, especially if you’re accustomed to using wrapper libraries.
