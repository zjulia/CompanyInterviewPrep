INTERVIEW PREPARATION AND OVERVIEW
Here’s an overview of your schedule for the day:

3 Pair Programming Interviews
This is where you and a Square engineer sit down at a computer together with two mice and keyboards. You can expect some amount of collaboration and assistance from your interviewer, but you should expect to drive the problem solving and implementation more so than you would in a real life pair programming environment.
You can program in the language of your choice - choose one that highlights your expertise, rather than one you just recently learned. You don’t need to memorize every nuance of the standard library of your language. Just like in a normal workday, if you need to use an API that you’re not familiar with, you can look it up or ask your interviewer.
The interviewer will present a question and you will have approximately 45 minutes to come to a working solution. 
Our interview questions cover standard topics you might encounter in your work, such as requirements analysis, object oriented programming, data structures, and algorithms. Run your code early and often, rather than waiting until the end.
There should be about 10-15 minutes at the end to ask questions about our teams, company culture, or anything else on your mind.
Lunch
Please let us know if you have any dietary restrictions and we’ll be happy to accommodate.
Q&A Sessions
Past Experience
It’s easy, just talk about yourself and your accomplishments!
Think about your responsibilities at your current company. Be prepared to explain the architecture of the systems you worked on and the design decisions for which you were responsible.
Be sure to provide detailed responses about what you worked on and the impact you had.
Architecture and Design
This section will require some whiteboarding (no additional coding). For example, they may ask you to design a hotel booking system. 
You will be asked to create a visual of your approach on a whiteboard and provide a high level overview. 
Make sure to discuss your approach and thought process throughout each step of the presentation.
Focus on what you are good at. We want you to design a system that shows off your knowledge and skills.
